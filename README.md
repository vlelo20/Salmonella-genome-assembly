#Genome Assembly and Reference Comparison of *Salmonella enterica*
Author: Vian Lelo

Introduction

Whole‑genome assembly of bacterial pathogens has become a central tool in microbiology, epidemiology, and public health. Salmonella enterica is a prokaryotic, Gram‑negative bacterial pathogen responsible for a substantial burden of foodborne disease worldwide, with infections ranging from self‑limiting gastroenteritis to invasive systemic disease. Its genome typically consists of a single circular chromosome of ~4.5–5.0 Mb, often accompanied by one or more plasmids that can carry virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants (Baker and Dougan 2007). High‑quality, complete genome assemblies for S. enterica enable precise serovar determination, outbreak reconstruction, plasmid tracking, and comparative genomics, all of which depend on accurate reconstruction of both chromosomal and extrachromosomal replicons (Zhao et al. 2023; Wick, Judd, and Holt 2023). 

Historically, bacterial genome assembly relied on short‑read sequencing (e.g., Illumina), which provides highly accurate reads but struggles with repetitive regions, mobile elements, and plasmids. These limitations often result in fragmented assemblies composed of many contigs, complicating downstream analyses such as structural variant detection, plasmid–chromosome distinction, and accurate gene context inference (Wick, Judd, and Holt 2023). Long‑read sequencing technologies, particularly Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have transformed bacterial genomics by producing reads that span repeats and structural variants, enabling near‑complete or fully closed assemblies for many bacterial species (Purushothaman et al. 2026). For S. enterica, which contains repetitive rRNA operons, insertion sequences, and diverse plasmids, long reads are especially valuable for resolving genome structure and capturing clinically relevant mobile genetic elements (Helm et al. 2003).

Oxford Nanopore’s R10 chemistry with Q20+ basecalling represents a substantial improvement in raw read accuracy compared to earlier ONT chemistries. Recent work has shown that ONT long reads alone can generate complete bacterial and plasmid genomes without the need for short‑read data, provided that appropriate assembly and polishing workflows are used (Zhao et al. 2023). Meta‑analyses and benchmarking studies of long‑read assemblers for bacterial pathogens have demonstrated that modern ONT‑focused assemblers can routinely produce single‑contig chromosomal assemblies and accurately reconstruct plasmids, with error rates that are acceptable for many comparative and clinical applications, especially after polishing (Chen, Erickson, and Meng 2020).

Several studies have systematically compared long‑read assemblers and polishing strategies for bacterial genomes. Chen et al. (2023) benchmarked multiple long‑read assemblers on ONT data from bacterial pathogens and found that tools such as Flye, Canu, and Raven can generate highly contiguous assemblies, with Flye often performing particularly well in terms of contiguity and correctness for ONT data. Wick et al. (2023) proposed a best‑practice pipeline for “perfect” bacterial genome assembly using ONT and Illumina reads, recommending Medaka for ONT‑based polishing, highlighting the importance of both assembler choice and polishing strategy. More recent evaluations of ONT versus Illumina platforms for bacterial whole‑genome sequencing in clinical microbiology emphasize that ONT’s long reads enable complete genome reconstruction and plasmid resolution, while short reads still offer advantages in per‑base accuracy; together, they provide complementary strengths for high‑confidence variant calling and outbreak analysis.

For this assignment, the focus is on ONT R10/Q20+ long reads with an N50 of 5–15 kb, which are well suited to de novo assembly of S. enterica. The key challenges in assembling such data include handling residual basecalling errors (particularly in homopolymers), correctly resolving repetitive regions and plasmids, and avoiding misassemblies that could confound downstream variant calling. Long‑read assemblers such as Flye are specifically designed to work with noisy long reads, constructing repeat graphs and leveraging read length to resolve complex regions (Oxford Nanopore Assembly using Flye 2025). However, even with improved Q20+ accuracy, ONT assemblies typically require polishing to reduce small indel and substitution errors that can impact gene prediction and variant analysis. Tools like Medaka, which use neural network models trained on ONT data, have been shown to substantially improve consensus accuracy when applied to ONT assemblies (Wick, Judd, and Holt 2023)

Aligning the assembled genome to a reference is essential for variant calling and comparative analysis. Minimap2 has emerged as the standard aligner for long‑read data, offering high speed and accuracy for mapping ONT reads or assembled contigs to reference genomes. In contrast, short‑read aligners such as BWA‑MEM and Bowtie2, and RNA‑seq‑focused tools like STAR, HISAT2, or Salmon, are optimized for different data types and are not appropriate for ONT whole‑genome bacterial assemblies. Once alignments are generated, variant callers designed for long reads, such as Medaka’s variant pipeline, can identify single‑nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels between the assembled S. enterica genome and a reference. Visualization tools like IGV allow manual inspection of alignments and variants.

In summary, assembling and comparing a Salmonella enterica genome from ONT R10/Q20+ reads involves balancing the strengths and limitations of long‑read sequencing. ONT provides long reads that enable complete, structurally accurate assemblies and plasmid resolution, but residual basecalling errors necessitate careful polishing and appropriate variant calling strategies. Meta‑analyses and recent methodological papers support the use of long‑read assemblers like Flye, ONT‑aware polishers like Medaka, and long‑read aligners like minimap2 as a robust foundation for bacterial genome assembly and comparative genomics. This assignment will apply these principles to generate a consensus S. enterica genome, align it to a reference, call variants, and visualize the results.

#Methods proposed:

##Quality control and read filtering
Initial quality control will be performed using NanoPlot (v1.x) to assess read length distributions, quality scores, and yield, confirming that the N50 falls within the expected 5–15 kb range and identifying any obvious issues with the sequencing run. If necessary, reads will be filtered using Filtlong (v0.x) to remove very short or low‑quality reads, which can reduce noise and computational burden without compromising assembly quality. For example, a minimum read length of 1,000 bp and retention of the top 70-80% of bases by quality may be used (), consistent with common ONT bacterial assembly workflows. Downsampling may be considered to reduce runtime and memory usage (Wick, Judd, and Holt 2023). 

##De novo genome assembly
De novo assembly will be performed using Flye (v2.9.6), a long‑read assembler that has been extensively benchmarked on ONT bacterial data and shown to produce highly contiguous assemblies. The preset "hq" and an expected genome size of 5 Mb will be set. Flye constructs a repeat graph from the long reads and resolves repeats using read length and coverage, making it well suited for S. enterica genomes that contain repetitive elements and plasmids. The expected outcome is a small number of contigs, ideally a single chromosomal contig and one or more plasmid contigs.

##Assembly polishing
To improve the base‑level accuracy of the Flye assembly, ONT‑specific polishing will be performed using Medaka (v2.2.0), which applies neural network models trained on ONT data to correct systematic errors. The appropriate Medaka model for R10/Q20+ chemistry (e.g.,  or similar, depending on the exact kit and basecaller) will be selected according to ONT documentation. Polishing will be performed by aligning the original ONT reads back to the Flye assembly using minimap2 (see below), followed by Medaka consensus calling to generate a polished assembly. If short‑read data were available, additional polishing with tools such as Polypolish or Pilon could be considered to further reduce residual errors, but for this assignment the focus will be on ONT‑only polishing, consistent with recent demonstrations that ONT alone can yield complete bacterial genomes.

##Reference genome retrieval
A reference genome for Salmonella enterica will be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq, ideally matching the serovar of the sequenced isolate if known (e.g., S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2). The reference will be obtained in FASTA format along with its annotation (GenBank or GFF), enabling both sequence‑level and feature‑level comparisons. Using a well‑annotated RefSeq reference facilitates interpretation of variants in terms of genes, operons, and known virulence or resistance loci.

##Alignment and variant calling
Long‑read alignment will be performed using minimap2 (v2.28), which is widely regarded as the standard aligner for ONT reads due to its speed and accuracy. For read‑to‑assembly and read‑to‑reference alignments, the  preset will be used. The resulting SAM files will be converted to BAM, sorted, and indexed using Samtools (v1.21), which also provides basic statistics and depth information. To compare the polished assembly to the reference genome, the assembly itself may also be aligned to the reference using minimap2 in assembly‑to‑reference mode.

Variant calling will be carried out using a long‑read‑aware variant caller using Medaka’s variant pipeline, both of which have been shown to perform well on ONT data. These tools take the minimap2‑aligned BAM files as input and produce VCF files containing SNVs and small indels. The choice of caller will be justified based on its performance in recent benchmarking studies and its suitability for ONT R10/Q20+ data. Variants will be filtered using recommended quality thresholds, and summary statistics (e.g., number of SNVs, indels, and their distribution across the genome) will be generated.

##Visualization and comparative analysis
Visualization of read alignments and variants will be performed using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), which allows interactive inspection of coverage, alignment quality, and specific variant sites. IGV will be used to validate variant calls in regions of interest and to inspect any suspicious regions (e.g., low coverage, potential misassemblies). To visualize the assembly structure, Bandage may be used to inspect the Flye assembly graph, confirming that the chromosome and plasmids are resolved into complete circular contigs. Whole‑genome comparison between the polished assembly and the reference will be performed using MUMmer4 (e.g.,  and ), providing dotplots and summary metrics such as average nucleotide identity, number of SNPs, and structural differences.
